# ionic-brunch-es6-seed

This is a starter project for a mobile/desktop application based on [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and
[Brunch](http://brunch.io). [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is provided as an optional runtime for a desktop app. 
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your app on a modern language platform, while enjoying smooth development 
experience and compile time safety across your entire stack of static resources.
